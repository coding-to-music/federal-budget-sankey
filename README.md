# Federal Budget Sankey

[Live Demo](https://masonchinkin.github.io/budgetSankey/)

![](https://github.com/MasonChinkin/budgetSankey/blob/master/dist/budgetsankey.gif)

I always felt sankeys were underutilized as a tool to communicate fiscal policy. Maybe now I know why, because this was not trivial! I made this just before I began my journey to be a full stack engineer and am in the process of improving the code quality.

## Features

- d3.js based dashboard gives 3 slices of fiscal data since 1968: 1) bar chart showing the overall balance, 2) sankey showing the revenue/spending flows, and 3) line charts showing the history for each category.
- Sankey transitions to any year selected with the slider.
- Hovering the mouse over a category highlights it in the sankey and line charts.

## Highlights

### Sankey Transition: onchange vs end

The sankey animation was a nice lesson in onchange vs end. I only want to bind new data when the user makes a choice by releasing the mouse button, which is the end event.

```javascript
const slider = d3Slider
  .sliderHorizontal()
  .min(1968)
  .max(2017)
  .step(1)
  .width(barsContainer.offsetWidth - 62)
  .tickFormat(d3.format(".4"))
  .default(2017)
  .on("onchange", (thisYear) => {
    // when user drags mouse
    updateBars(thisYear);
    updateThisYearLine(thisYear);
  })
  .on("end", (thisYear) => {
    // when user releases mouse
    d3.csv("data/us-budget-sankey-main.csv").then((csv) => {
      d3.csv("data/us-budget-sankey-deficit.csv").then((deficit) => {
        //update
        d3.select(".deficit").remove();
        d3.select(".deficitLabel").remove();
        newData(csv, deficit, thisYear);
        updateSankey();
        setTimeout(() => drawDeficit(), newYearTransition);
      });
    });
  });
```

## About the Website: Maper

- A location-based website using React as Frontend and NodeJs, ExpressJS as backend, and MongoDB as Database. On this website, I had use MapBox for the world map and React-Mapbox-gl for configuration. We can select the place where we had visited and added the photo URL, so the entry will be seen on the map and in the visited place area. We can delete or modify the changes in the Entry we had created. It is a responsive website with live location of a point on the map. The Backend is deployed on Heroku and the frontend is deployed on Netlify.

#### The Password for the Entry: maper01

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## GitHub

```java
git init
git add .
git remote remove origin
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:coding-to-music/federal-budget-sankey.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Heroku

```java
heroku create federal-budget-sankey
```

## Heroku MongoDB Environment Variables

```java
heroku config:set

heroku config:set MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<userid>:<password>@cluster0.zadqe.mongodb.net/federal-budget-sankey?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
heroku config:set PASSWORD="something-secret"

heroku config:set PUBLIC_URL="https://federal-budget-sankey.herokuapp.com"
```

## Push to Heroku

```java
git push heroku

# or

npm run deploy
```

### Heroku Buildpack

See this repo for more info about setting up a node/react app on heroku:

https://github.com/mars/heroku-cra-node

```java
heroku buildpacks

heroku buildpacks --help

heroku buildpacks:clear

```

```java
heroku buildpacks
```

Output:

```java
=== federal-budget-sankey Buildpack URL
heroku/nodejs
```

### Notice we are doing a SET and then and ADD

```java
heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs

heroku buildpacks:add mars/create-react-app
```

Output:

```java
Buildpack added. Next release on federal-budget-sankey will use:
  1. heroku/nodejs
  2. mars/create-react-app
Run git push heroku main to create a new release using these buildpacks.
```

### Lets try reversing the order

```java
heroku buildpacks:set mars/create-react-app

heroku buildpacks:add heroku/nodejs
```

```java
heroku buildpacks
```

Output:

```java
=== federal-budget-sankey Buildpack URL
heroku/nodejs
```

### Push to Heroku

```
git push heroku
```
